== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Rentle cost something? =

We have four plans: FREE, BASIC, GROW, and ADVANCED. The FREE plan doesn’t cost anything. The paid plans start at $19.50/month. Learn more about the Plans [here](https://www.rentle.io/pricing).

= Do I need a credit card to sign up? =

Nope, you can start with Rentle Free, our forever-free plan.

= What is the right plan for me? =

Our general rule is that if you only operate online, you’re good with the FREE or BASIC plan. With BASIC, you get more customization options and lower payment processing fees.

If you also have a brick-and-mortar store, you will need the GROW plan to create orders for walk-in customers. The ADVANCED plan is for high-volume merchants that need many features.

= Can I also sell products and services with Rentle? =

Yes, you can. You can make products available for rent or sale and sell services like courses and tours. You can even cross-sell products and services by bundling them into packages.

= Does Rentle offer support? =

Yes. You can always contact us through chat or via email at [support@rentle.io](mailto:support@rentle.io). We also have an extensive [knowledge base](https://support.rentle.io) where you can find answers to your questions.

= Is Rentle secure? =

Rentle is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant and audited as such annually. Your and your customer's data is secured according to the highest standards.

= Are there any discounts for small businesses or non-profits? =

Yes. We apply an automatic 50% discount to your subscription for every month you make less than $1,000 in sales through Rentle.

= Can I use the same system for walk-in rentals? =

Yes. With Rentle, you can seamlessly incorporate online and offline sales without extra operational hassle.
